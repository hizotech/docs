To start using the Glyde Public API, you need access credentials. Depending on the authentication method required, this may include an API key or other secure tokens.

# Authentication
To ensure the security of your API calls, it's essential to include your unique secret key within the Authorization header for each request. You can conveniently handle and manage your API keys directly from your dashboard.

For your convenience, we offer  API token keys. These are designed for various purposes, such as initiating disbursements with Glyde, fetching transactions, and checking balances, among others. API token keys should be kept confidential at all times. If you suspect that your API token key has been compromised or if you need to reset it for any reason, you can easily manage it directly from the dashboard.

# Authorization
Authorization is a critical aspect of accessing our services. To authorize your access, you need to include your API token key in the Authorization header of every request you make. This ensures that your requests are authenticated and granted the necessary permissions.

# How to access API tokens on your dashboard
To access API tokens from the dashboard, simply navigate to the "API Keys" section. This allows you to manage and obtain the necessary API tokens required for authenticating your API calls.

To begin using the Glyde API, refer to the endpoint documentation below. Each section provides details on request parameters, response structures, and example payloads.
